poliastro is a pure Python package dedicated to problems arising in Astrodynamics and
Orbital Mechanics, such as orbit propagation, solution of the Lambert's
problem, conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical
orbital elements and orbit plotting.

.. code-block:: python

    from poliastro.examples import molniya
    from poliastro.plotting import plot
    
    plot(molniya)

Requirements
============

poliastro requires recent versions of NumPy, Astropy and numba to work.
Besides, matplotlib is needed for plotting the orbits.

poliastro is usually tested on Linux on Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 (single
codebase).

Installation
============

To install poliastro just use pip::

  $ pip install poliastro

To install poliastro from source, just type::

  $ python setup.py install

Development installations are also supported thanks to setuptools::

  $ python setup.py develop

It is recommended that you **never ever use sudo** with distutils, pip,
setuptools and friends in Linux because you might seriously break your
system [1_][2_][3_][4_]. Options are `per user directories`_, `virtualenv`_
or `local installations`_.

FAQ
===

Does it work on Windows and OS X too?
-------------------------------------

poliastro is a pure Python package with no compiled extensions, so
there is no reason it shouldn't work under Windows or Mac OS X with
properly installed dependencies (not tested).

What's up with the name?
------------------------

poliastro comes from Polimi, which is the shortened name of the Politecnico di
Milano, the Italian university where I was studying while writing this
software. It's my tiny tribute to a place I came to love. *Grazie mille!*
