These are some MATLAB/Octave subroutines required by the program. They come
from the companion MATLAB subroutines of Vallado, available from
http://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.asp, but were slightly modified
due to some errors and inconsistencies.

The tests are located in the `test` directory.
