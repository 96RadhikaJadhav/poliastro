* Use p or a consistently in the arguments
  The Gauss VOP equations use a, and the only reason to use p is for coe2rv
  function. OTOH, I might have to change the anomaly too.

* Create pythonic interface for uplanet_2013, adding constants for the bodies

* Try in Windows

* Remove all trace of MATLAB scripts: replace rv2coe with Fortran version
  and write Meeus numerical ephemeris.

* Release
