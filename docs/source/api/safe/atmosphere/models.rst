Models
======

The `U.S Standard atmosphere` or `COESA` was first published in 1958 as an extenmsion for
the `ISA atmosphere`. This model has suffered different updates (1962, 1966 and
last one in 1976). Only differences againts the `ISA atmosphere` are introduced
for high altitudes.

This model is a steady-state representation of mean annual conditions of Earth's
atmosphere at 45ÂºN latitude. It extends up to 1000 km geometric altitude. Main
characteristics are:

- Valid up to 1000 km.
- Up to 32 km is identical to ISA-ICAO.
- Between 32 km up to 55 km, model was developed from rocketsonde observations.
- Between 55 km up to 86 km, model was developed by using falling spheres.
- From 86 km till 1000 km, observational data was used to model this atmosphere.
