What's new
==========

New in poliastro 0.3.0
----------------------

This is a new major release, focused on switching to a pure Python codebase.
Lambert problem solving and ephemerides computation came back, and a couple
of bugs were fixed.

New features:

* **Pure Python codebase**: Forget about Fortran linking problems and
  nightmares on Windows, because now poliastro is a pure Python package.
  A new dependency, numba, was introduced to accelerate the algorithms,
  but poliastro will use it only if it is installed.
* **Lambert problem solving**: WIP
* `PR #42`_: **Planetary ephemerides computation**: WIP
* `PR #38`_: New method ``State.parabolic`` to create parabolic orbits.
* New conda package: visit `poliastro binstar channel`_!
* New organization and logo.

.. _`PR #42`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/42
.. _`PR #38`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/38

.. _`poliastro binstar channel`: https://binstar.org/poliastro

Bugs fixed:

* `Issue #19`_: Fixed plotting region for parabolic orbits.
* `Issue #37`_: Fixed creation of parabolic orbits.

.. _`Issue #37`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/37

New in poliastro 0.2.1
----------------------

This is a bugfix release, no new features were introduced since 0.2.0.

* Fixed `#35`_ (failing tests with recent astropy versions), thanks to
  Sam Dupree for the bug report.
* Updated for recent Sphinx versions.

New in poliastro 0.2
--------------------

* **Totally refactored code** to provide a more pythonic API (see `PR #14`_
  and `wiki`_ for further information) heavily inspired by `Plyades`_ by
  Helge Eichhorn.

  * Mandatory use of **physical units** through :code:`astropy.units`.
  * Object-oriented approach: :py:class:`~poliastro.twobody.State` and
    :py:class:`~poliastro.maneuver.Maneuver` classes.
  * Vector quantities: results not only have magnitude now, but also direction
    (see for example maneuvers).

* Easy plotting of orbits in two dimensions using matplotlib.
* Module :code:`example` with sample data to start testing the library.

.. _`PR #14`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/14

.. _Plyades: https://github.com/helgee/Plyades

These features were removed temporarily not to block the release and will
see the light again in poliastro 0.3:

* Conversion between anomalies.
* Ephemerides calculations, will look into Skyfield and the JPL ephemerides
  prepared by Brandon Rhodes (see `issue #4`_).
* Lambert problem solving.
* Perturbation analysis.

.. _`issue #4`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/4
