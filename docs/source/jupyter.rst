Jupyter notebooks
=================

The following page contains a collection of practical examples and problem
solutions solved with **poliastro**. From interplanetary transfers, to asteroid
catching missions or even propagation under external perturbations. In addition,
user might find other kind of tutorials related on how to use and customize
plotting utilities, API capabilities and many other orbital mechanics topics.
