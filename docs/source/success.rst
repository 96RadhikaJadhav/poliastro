    *"We, at the Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics (ISPA,
    University of Karachi), are using Poliastro as part of Space Flight
    Dynamics Text Book development program. The idea is to develop a book
    suitable for undergrad students which will not only cover theoretical
    background but will also focus on some computational tools. We chose
    Poliastro as one of the packages because it was very well written and
    provided results with good accuracy. It is especially useful in covering
    some key topics like the Lambert's problem. We support the use of
    Poliastro and open source software because they are easily accessible to
    students (without any charges, unlike some other tools). A great plus
    point for Poliastro is that it is Python based and Python is now becoming
    a very important tool in areas related to Space Sciences and Technologies."*
